    <h1>Letters From Room A110</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Room A110 Mein Pehli Nazar</h2>
    <p><em>— Narrated by Sakshi Rana</em></p>

    <blockquote>

      Masoom, naye, aur hamesha yaad rehne waale…”
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Quantum University, Chhutmalpur</h3>
    <p><strong>10th September 2023 | 9:00 AM</strong><br/>
    <strong>Room A110 – BCA Section B</strong><br/>
    <strong>Subject:</strong> C Programming Theory<br/>
    <strong>Faculty:</strong> Reshoo Devi Ma’am</p>

    <p>That morning, the campus felt alive with promise. A gentle breeze carried the scent of fresh blooms from the university gardens. Blocks echoed with excited chatter, backpacks rustled, and shoes tapped on cool stone floors as new students chased their first-day jitters away.</p>

    <p>I gripped my new notebook tight in my hands as I made my way up to Block A. With every step, my pulse raced faster—this was it: the real start of my college life.</p>

    <p>Upon reaching A110, I paused. The classroom door was slightly open, the bench rows empty except for a few eager souls arriving early. I found my seat: <strong>third bench from the front, window side</strong>. A perfect blend of visibility and comfort. I settled in, inhaling the mild scent of chalk dust and paper.</p>

    <p>Seconds felt like minutes. I closed my eyes for one deep breath before slipping into my seat. Everything around me was new yet buzzing with memories waiting to happen.</p>

    <p>At exactly <strong>9:08 AM</strong>, the door creaked open. A hush fell over the room. I looked up—and there he was.</p>

    <h3>Slow Motion Entry: The Boy in the Hoodie</h3>
    <p>Silence stretched between heartbeats as he walked in wearing a black hoodie, faded jeans, and sneakers dusted from the morning pavement. He carried a notebook and seemed oblivious to the attention he drew.</p>
    <p>There were no greetings, no forced smiles. He scanned the room once—almost mechanically—before choosing <strong>the last bench in the corner</strong>. He didn't ask for directions or apologize for being late. He simply sat down, placed his notebook on the desk, and waited.</p>
    <p>In that moment, everything around me blurred. His calm energy—contrasted with the nervous flurry of other students—felt strangely powerful. I wasn’t staring; it was more like... observing fate at work.</p>

    <p class="italic"><em>“Aditya Prajapati, ma’am... from Patna.”</em></p>
    <p>Reshoo ma’am’s voice broke the silence. He stood and answered, eyes forward, in a tone both clear and unhurried.</p>

    <p>I turned my gaze back to the window until the lecture began, but I couldn’t ignore the way my heart had skipped.</p>

    <h3>C Programming Begins</h3>
    <p>Reshoo Devi Ma’am started the class: “C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972…”</p>
    <blockquote>“C language was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972…”</blockquote>
    <p>From that moment, pens scratched on pages, notebooks opened wide, and definitions and data types filled the benches. But for me, the real note-taking began in observation.</p>

    <p>I peeked at the back. He already had half his page filled with neat lines. His handwriting looked practiced, fluid—almost poetic.</p>
    <p class="italic"><em>“Yeh toh introvert genius lagta hai.”</em></p>

    <p>The air tingled with unspoken awareness.</p>

    <h3>Roll Call</h3>
    <p>One by one, names were called:</p>
    <p>
      "Aditya Prajapati?"</p>
    <p>He raised his hand softly. While everyone else spoke up loudly, he simply whispered: <strong>“Present, ma’am.”</strong></p>
    <p>All eyes turned. Mine stayed locked until he lowered his gaze—but not before our eyes met for a fleeting moment.</p>
    <p>You don’t fall in love on sight. Maybe you fall in curiosity instead.</p>

    <h3>After Class — The Silent Moment</h3>
    <p>Class ended, and the room burst into motion. Landing pages of groups forming, friends gathering, laughs drifting into the corridor. Few lingered behind.</p>
    <p>I saw him still sitting. So strangely still.</p>
    <p>I dropped my pen “accidentally.” It slid to the front of his bench. He looked down, bent, and picked it up. I reached out. Our fingers brushed.</p>
    <p>“Thanks,” I whispered, cheeks warm. He nodded. No smile—just steady silence filled with meaning.</p>

    <h3>That Evening – My Hostel Window</h3>
    <p>Back in my hostel room, I sat cross-legged by the window with the golden sunset spilling in. My diary opened to a blank page—until I wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Quantum Day 1 – Room A110<br/>
      Met a boy—quiet, hoodie-wearing, last-bench seated from Patna.<br/>
      Didn’t talk much… but I felt something.<br/>
      Don’t know what this is yet. But maybe, just maybe—<br/>
      some stories start in silence.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>An unfamiliar warmth filled me. I'd always thought friendships started loud. But today's silence felt like the first beat of something honest.</p>

    <h3>Evening Reverie</h3>
    <p>As I lay down, I imagined him writing in the last corner of the classroom. I wondered if he found me curious or just another face. I tried replaying our one glance together—and it felt like destiny whispered.</p>

    <h3>Final Scene: The Thought That Stayed</h3>
    <p>He didn’t say anything poetic. He didn’t laugh loudly. He barely smiled.</p>
    <p>But when he walked in, I noticed. When he returned my pen, I remembered.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "Pehla nasha, pehla khumaar…<br/>
      Naya pyaar hai, naya intezaar..."
    </blockquote>

    <p>That night, I didn’t dream of acing tests or topping classes. I sneaked in thoughts of that last-bench boy from Patna—maybe, he’s unknowingly become the soft echo in my new story.</p>
